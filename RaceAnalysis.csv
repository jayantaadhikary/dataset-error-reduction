high8007.txt,"On March 19, 2013, Malala Yousafzai, a 15-year-old Pakistani student and women's-education activist , returned to the classroom for the first time since being attacked by a member of the Taliban on October 9, 2012. Malala was shot on her way home from school in Mingora, Pakistan. The Taliban  said that they did the attack. The group said the attack should be a warning to others. Malala was targeted  because she expresses her opinion publicly about girls' rights to education.
After a long period of recovery, Malala is starting as a ninth-year student at Edgbaston High School. It is the oldest independent girl's school in Birmingham, England. Though she has no specific plans to return to Pakistan, Malala still speaks out as a voice for change in her country, and everywhere. ""I'm excited that today I have realized my dream of going back to school. I want all girls in the world to have this kind of chance,"" Malala said in a statement .
Malala has been an Internet blogger since she was 11 years old. In 2011 she was awarded Pakistan's National Peace Award for her bravery in writing about the difficulties of life and education in the shadow of the Taliban. She has spoken publicly about children's rights and been nominated  for an international children's peace prize.",D,We can learn from the passage that Malala  _  .,"['is now attending school in Pakistan', 'is still under the shadow of the attack', 'has made a careful plan for her future', 'cares about the situation in her home country']",D. cares about the situation in her home country
high13164.txt,"Kendall Ciesemier is the founder of charity Kids Caring 4 Kids, an organization she created after seeing a show on the difficult situation of AIDS orphans   in Africa. Ciesemier was inspired to try to change the lives of those affected by AIDS and to encourage other children to do the same. She tells us of the power her personal story has in showing others they too can make a difference.
You saw Oprah's show on AIDS orphans when you were 11 -- do you remember how you felt?
When I saw the show I was shocked. I had never heard of AIDS before and was concerned that kids were growing up without parents and no one had troubled to ask for my help.
I wanted to create a place for kids to get involved and a place where their small contributions would be valued and celebrated. I also felt that I needed to take immediate action myself. I found an orphan sponsorship   program online and an eight-year-old girl from Mauritania who needed my help. I started there and Kids Caring 4 Kids grew from that experience.
How has your own illness inspired you to help others?
Growing up with a rare liver   disease made me feel different, which I think attracted me to others who were different and those struggling with something. I knew how I felt and I wanted to help reduce that feeling in someone else. I always wanted to support people. Growing up with an illness gave me empathy   for others.
How does your own story inspire others?
My own personal story is evidence that people can give from anywhere. I started Kids Caring 4 Kids from a hospital room. I started by helping one person and it snowballed from there. When I share my story, I think that's what affects people the most -- the fact that I started all of this during a time of personal struggle and weakness. If I could do that, then they can do something too.",D,Ciesemier's own illness .,"['caused her to lose some close friends', 'made her discouraged and less enthusiastic', 'kept her away from those who were different', ""helped her easily understand other patients' feelings""]",helped her easily understand other patients' feelings

high22198.txt,"I had in my hand a sheet of paper with handwritten instructions on it for some sort of editorial task.It occurred at first that I did not recognize the handwriting,and then I realized whose it must be.I finally became aware of the fact that I had been working with this colleague for at least a year,maybe two,and yet I did not recognize her handwriting at that point.
    It was a very important event in the computerization of life--a sign that the informal.friendly communication of people working together in an office had changed from notes in pen to instant messages and emails.There was a time when our workdays were filled with little letters,and we recognized one another's handwriting the way we knew voices or faces.

    All this has been on my mind because of the talk aboutThe Rise and Fall of Handwriting,a book by Florey.She shows in her book a deep concern about the fall of handwriting and the failure of schools to teach children to write well,but many others argue that people in a digital age can't be expected to learn to hold a pen.
    I don't buy it.
    I don't want to see anyone cut off from the expressive,personal associations that a pen still promotes better than a digital keyboard does.For many a biographer,part of really getting to know their subjects is learning to read their handwriting.

Know what shows your kids are watching on television. It is important to know the content of every program your child watches. As a rule, most programs will either work to reinforce your values or oppose them. This is why it is so important to be aware of a program's content.
Don't put a television in their bedrooms. A television in your child's bedroom is a big no-no. You won't be able to monitor the content, and our kids may be drawn to their rooms. A television in the bedroom is a far too attractive temptation for your kids.
Set limits on TV time. What are your guidelines, rules, and expectations for television viewing? Setting limits may be challenging, but if you insist, the results are well worth it.
Talk with your kids about TV shows. All television is educational. The question is what does it teach? Watch television with your kids, and then discuss with them the themes and content afterward.

high22.txt,"A green house is a building made of glass which is used for keeping warm when the outside temperature is low. In a similar way there are several gases in the atmosphere (mixture of gases that surround the earth) which trap the heat produced by the sun and prevent it from escaping. These gases are known as ""greenhouse gases"". And the way in which they trap heat in the atmosphere is called the ""greenhouse effect"". This is not simply air pollution. Most of the main greenhouse gases exist naturally in small amounts in our atmosphere, and without them the earth would be 30 degrees colder and human life would not exist. In other words, the greenhouse effect is a natural course which is to some degree helpful to us.
The problem is that in the last century and a half, we have been putting too many of these gases into the earth's atmosphere by burning large quantities of coal and oil and by cutting down forest. The rapid increase in greenhouse gases is making the world warmer. The world's temperature has already gone up by half a degree this century, and the sea level has risen by 10 centimetres. If the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles, there will probably be a rise in the earth's temperature of between I and 4degC;. This may seem a small increase, but it would be enough to cause major changes in geography and agriculture. Large areas of the world would be flooded, and some areas would become dry and unable to produce crops. It is important, too, to consider that there may be a delay of about 30 years in the greenhouse effect. This means that we are probably experiencing only now the effect of the gases put into the atmosphere before the 1960s.

high24105.txt,"Today we have the second report explaining how to prepare fish by drying or smoking them. We talked last week about the first steps of cleaning and salting freshly caught fish.
To dry fish, you will need either a drying table or a place to hang them. If a table is used, it should have a top made of wire screen or thin pieces of wood with space between each piece. 
Lay the cleaned, wet salted fish on top of the table. Do not let them touch each other. Be sure that air can reach the fish from all sides. 
     _ Turn the fish over every other day. Small fish will dry in about three days if the air is dry. Large fish will take a week or ten days to dry.
After the fish have dried, place them in a basket. Cover them with clean paper or large leaves. Then put the basket in a cool, dry place off the ground. 
Make sure as much of the saltwater as possible is removed before you smoke the fish.
The smoking can be done in a large, round metal container. Remove the top of the drum and cut a small opening on one side at the bottom.
Cover the top with a strong wire screen, where you put the fish. Build a small fire in the drum by reaching in through the opening at the bottom. 
Wood from fruit trees makes good fuel for your fire.  _ will give the smoked fish good color1 and taste. One way to get a lot of smoke is to use green wood, not dried wood.

high16792.txt,"It is often said that politeness costs nothing.In fact,it seems that a little more courtesy could save businessesPS5 billion every year.
Frequently hearing the phrase ""thank you"" or ""well done"" means the same to staff as a modest pay rise,researchers say.
Praise and encouragement also makes employees more likely to work hard and stay in their jobs,saving on the cost of finding replacements.
A third of 1,000 workers surveyed by consulting firm White Water Strategies said they did not get thanked at all when they did well--and a further third said they were not thanked enough.
In both cases,staff said they felt undervalued,meaning they were less likely to exert themselves and were more likely to look for employment elsewhere.
The net result is around PS5.2 billion in lost productivity from employees who would raise their game if they felt more appreciated,White Water claimed According to the company,praising staff has the same motivational kick as a 1 per cent pay rise--and works out much cheaper for bosses.
Three out of four employees said that regular acknowledgement by their boss was important to them,but only a quarter said they were actually given as much praise as they felt they needed.
The survey found that those in blue-collar and manual jobs were less likely to be given any recognition for doing well.
In regional terms,Scottish staff felt most undervalued.Four out of ten workers said they were never thanked and eight out of ten said they would like more praise.However,workers in the North-East are less impressed by being buttered up by the boss,as only 69 per cent said they felt the need to be told ""well done""regularly.

And so in June of eighteen seventy-seven,the Nez Perce left their home in the Wallowa Valley. They left quickly. They were able to take only a small part of what they owned,and just a few cattle and Appaloosa horses.
When the Indians reached the Snake River,the water was very deep and ran very fast with melted snow from the mountains. Chief Joseph and his people made boats from sticks and dried animal skins to cross the river. While the Indians were busy,a group of white men came and stole some of the cattle waiting at the edge of the river.
The other chiefs demanded that Joseph call a meeting. Two of the chiefs,White Bird and Toohoolhoolzote,spoke for War,but Joseph held different opinion.
Some of the young men in White Bird's group were very angry. That night,they rode into the countryside and killed eleven white persons.
During all his years as chief,Joseph had tried to keep the peace. Now he saw there was no hope. Although he and his young men had taken no part in the killings,he knew that the white men would blame all of the Indians. Chief Joseph said,""I would have given my own life if I could have undone the killing of the white men.""
Many Nez Perce fled. Chief Joseph remained,because his wife was about to have a baby. After she gave birth,he and his family joined the others in White Bird Canyon to the south.
Joseph wanted to lead the people to safety in the flat lands of Montana. But the United States army quickly sent horse soldiers to follow them.

high4016.txt,"Plants have family values, too; it seems, with new research suggesting they can recognize close relatives in order to work together.
An ability to tell family from strangers is well known in animals, allowing them to cooperate and share resources, but plants may possess similar social skills, scientists believe.
Susan Dudley and Amanda File of McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, report they have demonstrated for the first time that plants can recognize their kin.
This suggests that plants, though lacking recognition and memory, are capable of complex social interactions.
""Plants have this kind of hidden but complicated social life,"" Dudley said.
The study found plants from the same species of beach-dwelling wildflower grew aggressively alongside unrelated neighbors but were less competitive when they shared soil with their families.
Sea rocket, a North American species, showed stronger and healthier root growth when planted in pots with strangers than when raised with relatives from the same maternal  family, the study found.
This is an example of kin selection, a behavior common in animals in which closely related individuals take a group approach to succeeding in their environment, the researchers said.
Kin selection also applies to competition, because if family members compete less with each other, the group will do better overall. ""Everywhere you look, plants are growing right up next to other plants,"" Dudley said,"" Usually it's a case of each plant for itself. But sometimes those plants are related, and there are benefits to not wasting resources on being competitive, and there is not really a cost to not being competitive as long as your neighbor is also not being competitive.""
Learning and memory appear to be important for kin recognition in animals, but this isn't an option for plants, she noted.

This was an age before telephones.Someone was delivering a message.When Colcridge got back to his poem, he had lost his inspiration.His poetic mood had been broken by the knock on his
door.His unfinished poem, which could otherwise have been a masterpiece, would now never be more than a fragment(,).
This story tells how unexpected communication can destroy an important thought, which brings us to the cell phone.
The most common complaint about cell phones is that people talk on them to the annoyance of people around them.But marc damaging may be the cell phone's disruption of our thoughts.
We have already entered a golden age of little white lies about our call phones, and this is by and large a healthy, productive development."" I didn't hear it ring"" or "" I didn't realize my cell phone had shut off"" arc among the lies we tell to give ourselves space where we're beyond reach.
The notion or idea of being unreachable is not a new concept-we havoc ""Do Not Disturb"" signs on the doors of hotel rooms. So why must we feel guilty when it comes to cell phones? Why must we apologize if we decide to shut off the phone for a while?
The problem is that we come from a long-established tradition of difficulty with distance communication.Until the recent mass deployment of cell phones, it was easy to communicate with someone next to us or a few feet away, but difficult with someone across town, the country or the
globe.We came to take it for granted.
But cell phones make long-distance communication common, and endanger our time by ourselves.Now time alone, or conversation with someone next to us which cannot be interrupted by a phone, is something to be cherished.Even cell phone devotees, myself usually included, can't help at times wanting to throw their cell phone away, or curse the day they were invented.
But we don't and won't, and there really is no need.All that's required to take back our private time is a general social recognition that we have the right to it.
In other words, we have to develop a healthy contempt for the rings of our phones.Given the case of making and receiving cell phone calls, if we don-t talk to the caller right now, we surely will shortly later.
A cell phone call deserves no greater priority than a random word from a person next to us.Though the call on my cell phone may be the one-in-a-million from Steven Spielberg-who has  finally read my novel and wants to make it his next movie.But most likely it is not, and I'm better

high19910.txt,"Despite the anxiety that Jones' Host--said by some to be the first digital novel--caused in 1993, publishers weren't too concerned that e-books would one day replace printed books. However, that attitude was changed suddenly in 2007 when Amazon's Kindle came onto the market, which led to e-book sales jumping up to 1,260%. Since then, e-books' popularity has continued to rise steadily. The publishing industry seemed to have lost all possible ability to regain its position. Will printed books eventually become a thing of the past?
According to Mike Shatzkin, founder and CEO of the Idea Logical Company, printed books just for plain old reading will, in 10 years from now, be unusual. ""Not so unusual that a kid will say, 'Mommy, what's that?' but unusual enough that on the train you'll see one or two people reading something printed, while everyone else is reading off of a tablet."" And Shatzkin believes that the de mise of print is sure to happen, though such a day won't arrive for perhaps 50 to 100 or more years.
Robert Stein, founder of the Institute for the Future of the Book, however, believes that books won't disappear entirely, at least not anytime soon. ""Print will exist, but it will be in a
different field and will appeal to a very limited audience, as poetry does today. Like woodblock printing, hand-processed film and folk weaving  , printed pages may assume an artistic
value,"" he says. He imagines that future forms of books might be developed not by traditional publishers but by the gaming industry. He also predicts that the distinction between writer and reader will be made less obvious by a social reading experience in which authors and consumers can digitally interact with each other to discuss any passage, sentence or line.
Is there anything we risk sacrificing, should print really disappear entirely? According to Maryanne Wolf, director of the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts University, electronic reading can negatively affect the way the brain responds to text, including reading comprehension, focus and the ability to maintain attention to details like plot and order of events. ""My worry is that we'll have a short-circuited reading brain, excellent for gathering information but not necessarily for forming critical, analytical deep reading skills,"" Wolf says.
        The field, however, is in an early stage, and findings about the negative effects of e-reading are far from certain. In light of this, Wolf hopes that we continue to maintain a ""bi-literate"" society--one that values both the digital and printed word.

Many weight-conscious people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix _ . Perhaps our mistake is believing that being thin equals being loved, being special, and being cherished. We fantasize   about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal .We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there.
But we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally fulfill its promise of everlasting happiness, self-worth, and, of course, love.
It took me a long time to realize that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards vary with culture. In Samoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us strive hard to change our body, but in vain. We have to find a way to live comfortably inside our body and make friends with and cherish ourselves.

high10824.txt,"Throughout history, people have been interested in knowing how languages first began, but no one knows exactly where or how this happened. However, we do know a lot about languages, the languages of today and also the languages of earlier times. There are probably about 3,000 languages in the world today. Chinese is the language with the most speakers. English, Russian and Spanish are also spoken by many millions of people. On the other hand, some languages in the world have less than one hundred speakers.
There are several important families of languages in the world. For example, most of the languages of Europe are in one large family called Indo-European. The original   language of this family was spoken about 4,500 years ago. Many of the present day languages of Europe and India are modern forms of the language of 4,500 yeas ago.
Languages are always changing. The English of today is very different from the English of 500 years ago. In time some even died out completely. About 1,000 years ago, English was a little-known relative of German spoken on one of the borders of Europe.
If a language has a large number of speakers or if it is very old, there may be differences in the way it is spoken in different areas. That is, the language may have several dialects. Chinese is a good example of _ differences. Chinese has been spoken for thousands of years by many millions of speakers.

high7312.txt,"Language is a way to communicate with each other. We started to learn language when we were born. However, people are used to speaking their native language, so immigrants are having many problems between the first generation and the second generation because they don't have the same native language. Also, the second generation is losing their identity. Especially in America, there are many immigrants that came from different countries to succeed in the States.  Because they suffer in lots of areas such as getting a job and trying to speak English, they want their children to speak English, not only at school, but also at home in order to be more successful. Because of this situation, their children are losing their identity and, even more, they are ignoring their parents whose English is not very good.
I think most immigrants are trying to preserve their native language in their new country, but this doesn't help very much in getting a good job. My aunt taught Korean to her children not to help hem succeed in the U.S. she did so, hopefully, to help them establish a Korean identity. Though the second generation was born in the new country, they often get confused about their identity because they look different from others, and also, if they visit their parents' country, they will probably feel different from other people there too. My cousins told me that when they visited Korea a few years ago, they felt different from other Koreans. They could even feel it just strolling around the street because they wore different clothes and walked differently.
We must realize that language is important and valuable for many reasons.

Each day Lion took a long lazy sleep under the shade of his favourite tree.  He always dreamed of weaker animals bowing  before him.

high8510.txt,"When English as a foreign language is taught to children at the primary and early secondary levels of education, it is generally taught with a general education aim in mind--that is, it is regarded as a ""good thing"" for them to learn a foreign language as a part of a broad education. There is usually, however, no immediate and specific requirement for such children to make use of the language in any communicative situation. The purpose of learning the language is essentially a ""deferred""   purpose, deferred till the tertiary   level of education, normally at university, where, it is agreed, a knowledge of English would be helpful in their academic studies. Immediate aims of learning English are defined by the requirements of examinations. Inevitably what is taught to primary and secondary level children is not a communicative knowledge of English language use, but a knowledge of how the rules of English operate.
The language system is taught by means of systematic audio-lingual   drill and exercise techniques based on habit formation theory of learning and a structural description of English. This may be an effective manner of teaching English usage, but it is less certain that an understanding of how these rules are related to language in use for communicative purpose is an automatic result of this instruction.
What the thousands of children succeed in learning in this way is what is necessary in order to pass examinations. Whether such examinations accurately reflect the uses to which English will be put at the tertiary level is another matter altogether. Adults, on the other hand, unless they are learning a foreign language for ""pleasure"" at evening institutes, as a ""cultural"" and social experience, are generally highly conscious of the use to which they intend to put it. That use is frequently associated with an academic or professional requirement; without a knowledge of the foreign language, their development in their chosen sphere of work could be restricted or at least adversely affected.",C,Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?,"['English teaching should prepare children for the passing of examination.', 'English should be taught to children at primary and secondary levels.', 'English teaching should help students with their future academic studies.', 'English teaching at primary and secondary levels should focus only on grammar.']",English teaching should help students with their future academic studies.
