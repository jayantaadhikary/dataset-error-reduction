high10153.txt,"During the seasons of fine weather, kids can play outside, happy and active. But when winter comes around, it is wet, windy and cold. Since they can't go outside to play, kids get restless and miserable.
Fun activities for kids are pretty much necessary at that time of year, and they need to be kept entertained. One way to do this is to have an indoor treasure hunt, where children can look for clues and then get to the treasure. Treasure doesn't even need to be much, because just the activity is fun enough.
Art activities are always fun, and if you start off with some paper in different colors they can draws shapes on the back, cut them out and stick them on the white paper to make all sorts of things. Cardboard boxes, stuck together and then painted, can be made into buildings or robots. You can keep all boxes in a bag in the loft. Then you have something you can draw on when the weather is bad and the children need to play indoors.
Dressing up is another fun indoor activity. Why not read a book to them and then ask them to act it for you? That can keep them busy and develop their imagination. When you encourage children to use their imagination, you are giving them confidence in themselves, in their own creative abilities; by suggesting they put on a play you are encouraging them to work together and develop teamwork skills.
The best way to help your kids have fun when it is rainy outside is to let them come up with some ideas. When you feel that they are old enough, let them write their ideas on a piece of paper and you can pick an idea that you find practical. That way, every day can be fun!",B,The indoor treasure hunt is an activity in which kids  _  .,"['would like to get much treasure', 'are eager to find something', 'are forced to stay indoors', 'try to help each other.']",are eager to find something.
high2264.txt,"Dear editor,
Mary is my friend and she is a very good-hearted girl. She's always the first to help out others. But her habits make me mad sometimes and she just won't change her ways. For most situations, that's just fine with me, as I know it's what make her who she is. However, sometimes it's just so hard for me to bear her behavior. She has recently got a cellphone, but she often borrows mine to make calls. My phone has a chain with it. She always tries to open it like her own phone. I usually open it for her, but not always, as sometimes I'm driving my car, so she needs to get it out of my purse and open it herself.
This weekend we were at a party in a faraway village. She borrowed my cellphone. As it was cold outside, I let her take it outside without opening it. Now it's broken because she didn't open it properly. I wouldn't be so mad, but over the weekend she also borrowed my car and never offered to pay for the gas, which made me very angry. She should have offered to pay for the gas. As I have mentioned, she's the type to help out others when and where she can. Perhaps because of that, she thinks others should also do the same for her. Sometimes I just think she is very childish. I don't want to hurt her, but I do want to let her know that not everyone can accept that. What should I do to let her know that?
Yours,
Lily",D,What kind of person is Mary?,"['Friendly and beautiful.', 'Kind and careful.', 'Careful and childish.', 'Warm-hearted but childish']",Careful and childish.

high5724.txt,"Researchers claimed that waitresses who wear red get up to 26 percent extra in tips than they would wearing other colors. However, the team finds that the sexes tip very differently--with the bigger tips coming only from male customers.
No matter what color they wear, female diners will give the same kind of amounts for service every time. Yet men, whether they realize it or not, add anything between 15 and 26 percent more to a waitress in red than they would if it was the same waitress wearing a different color.
The test was simple. Take 11 waitresses in five restaurants over a six-week period and ask them to wear the same kind of T-shirt every day but change the colors. Previous research has suggested waitresses could earn more if they acted charmingly or wore more make-up than their colleagues. But this study, by the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Research, only changed the color of the T-shirt. Every other aspect from make-up to behavior remained the same.
When wearing either black, white, green, blue or yellow T-shirts, the size of the tips from both male and female customers was almost _ . But when they wore red, the size of the tips went up by between 15 and 26 percent from male customers, yet stayed the same from female ones.
A total of 272 restaurant customers were studied by researchers Nicolas Gueguen and Celine Jacob for the international journal of the tourism industry.
Even as a T-shirt, it shows just how much the color red is thought, by men, to increase the physical and sexual attractiveness of woman, said the researchers.
The researchers wrote: As red color has no negative effect on women customers, it could be in their interest to wear clothes at work.",B,What is the main idea of the passage?,"['People tip differently if waitresses wear different make-up.', 'Waitresses who wear red get more tips than they would wearing other colors.', 'Male customers are more interested in the red color.', 'Red color has no negative effect on female customers.']",B) Waitresses who wear red get more tips than they would wearing other colors.

high6771.txt,"Einstein's connection with the politics of the nuclear bomb is well known: He signed the letter to President Franklin Roosevelt that persuaded the United States to take the idea seriously, and he engaged in postwar efforts to prevent nuclear war. But these were not just the isolated actions of a scientist dragged into the world of politics. Einstein's life was, in fact, ""divided between politics and equations .""
Sickened by what he saw as the waste of human lives during the First World War, he became involved in antiwar demonstrations. His support of civil disobedience did little to endear him to his colleagues. Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation  and improving international relations. And soon his politics were making it difficult for him to visit the United States, even to give lectures.
Einstein's second great cause was Zionism . Although he was Jewish, Einstein rejected the idea of God. However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism , both before and during the War, led him gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism.
His theories came under attack. One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, ""If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!"" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany. While Nazi attacked his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed the headline ""Good News from Einstein--He's Not Coming Back.""
Fearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, Einstein proposed that the United States should develop its own. But he was publicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry. Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little and won him few friends. His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952, when he was offered the presidency of Israel. He declined, saying he was too naive in politics. But perhaps his real reason was different:""  Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity.""",B,We can learn from the passage that Einstein   _,"['believed in God', 'was proud of being Jewish', 'suggested that nuclear weaponry should be banned', 'made great achievements in peace']","belied in God, was proud of being Jewish, suggested that equations should be prioritized over politics, made great achievements in science (including theories related to the atomic bomb) but did not achieve significant progress in peace efforts."
high152.txt,"Everyone has got two personalities --the one that is shown to the world and the other that is secret and real .

In a normal night , of course , people frequently change their position . The important position is the one that you go to sleep in .
If you go to sleep in your back , you're a very open person ,. You normally trust people and you are easily influenced by fashion or new ideas . You don't like to upset people , so you never express your real feeling .
If you sleep on your stomach , you are a rather secretive person . You worry a lot and you're always easily upset . You're very stubborn , but you aren't very ambitious . You usually live for today not for tomorrow . This means that you enjoy having a good time .
If you sleep curled up  , you are probably a very nervous person . You have a low opinion of yourself so you're often defensive . You're shy and you don't normally like meeting people. You prefer to be on your own . you're easily hurt .

middle8117.txt,"Fire can help people in many ways. But it can also be very harmful. Fire can make water hot and house warm, give light and cook food. But fire can burn   things, too. It can make trees, houses, animals and other things catch fire  . If some people can't run away from fire, it can kill them. This happens in every country every year.
Sometimes big fire can burn forests. A month ago, a large forest fire broke out in Yunnan Province. It lasted nearly half a month. The forest in Heilongjiang Province and the grassland in Inner Mongolia caught fire in May, 2006. After more than ten days' fight, over 30,000 people and soldiers put out   the fire at last.
Nobody knows clearly when people began to make fire, but there are many interesting stories about the first time a man or a woman started a fire. One story from Australia tells about a man who went to the sun and brought fire down a long time ago. Today people know how to make a fire with matches  . Children sometimes like to play with them. But matches can be very dangerous. The match can burn a piece of paper and then it can burn a house. A small fire can become a big fire, and destroy many things. Fire kills many people every year. So you must be careful with fire.
,.",D,Which of the following is TRUE?,"['Someone started a fire in Heilongjiang Province.', 'Fire was brought down from the sun long, long ago.', 'We can only make a fire with a match.', 'Playing with fire is dangerous.']","Someone started a fire in Heilongjiang Province., Playing with fire is dangerous.
### Explanation:
The article states that over 30,000 people and soldiers fought to put out the fire in Heilongjiang Province. This implies that someone indeed started the fire. Additionally, the article mentions that ""a small fire can become a big fire, and destroy many things,"" implying that playing with fire is dangerous. Therefore, options A and D are the correct answers.
The other options are not directly stated in the article: someone did not bring fire down from the sun long, long ago (the story is just one of many), we can make a fire using various methods besides matches, such as friction or flint and steel."
