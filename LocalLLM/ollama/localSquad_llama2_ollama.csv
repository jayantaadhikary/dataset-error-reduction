33653,570e38eb0dc6ce1900204ea9,Uranium,"The use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 CE, when it was used to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes. Yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy, by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912. Starting in the late Middle Ages, pitchblende was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry.

2906,56d12ceb17492d1400aabb5d,The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess,"In 2003, Nintendo announced that a new The Legend of Zelda game was in the works for the GameCube by the same team that had created the cel-shaded The Wind Waker. At the following year's Game Developers Conference, director Eiji Aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game's sequel was in development under the working title The Wind Waker 2; it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor. Nintendo of America told Aonuma that North American sales of The Wind Waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience. Concerned that the sequel would have the same problem, Aonuma expressed to producer Shigeru Miyamoto that he wanted to create a realistic Zelda game that would appeal to the North American market. Miyamoto, hesitant about solely changing the game's presentation, suggested the team's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations. He advised that Aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in Ocarina of Time, particularly horseback combat.[l]",Who was the director that unintentionally announced a Zelda game was in the works?,"{'text': ['Eiji Aonuma'], 'answer_start': [224]}","{'text': 'Aonuma', 'answer_start': [326]}"

62957,57282cbd4b864d190016465a,LaserDisc,"At least where the digital audio tracks were concerned, the sound quality was unsurpassed at the time compared to consumer videotape, but the quality of the analog soundtracks varied greatly depending on the disc and, sometimes, the player. Many early and lower-end LD players had poor analog audio components, and many early discs had poorly mastered analog audio tracks, making digital soundtracks in any form most desirable to serious enthusiasts. Early DiscoVision and LaserDisc titles lacked the digital audio option, but many of those movies received digital sound in later re-issues by Universal, and the quality of analog audio tracks generally got far better as time went on. Many discs that had originally carried old analog stereo tracks received new Dolby Stereo and Dolby Surround tracks instead, often in addition to digital tracks, helping boost sound quality. Later analog discs also applied CX Noise Reduction, which improved the signal-noise ratio of their audio.",What result did adding CX Noise Reduction have on analog discs?,"{'text': ['improved the signal-noise ratio of their audio'], 'answer_start': [934]}","The answer to this question is ""It reduced noise in the analog discs""."
81805,5730d389b7151e1900c01554,United_States_Air_Force,"Defensive Counterair (DCA) is defined as ""all the defensive measures designed to detect, identify, intercept, and destroy or negate enemy forces attempting to penetrate or attack through friendly airspace"" (JP 1-02). A major goal of DCA operations, in concert with OCA operations, is to provide an area from which forces can operate, secure from air and missile threats. The DCA mission comprises both active and passive defense measures. Active defense is ""the employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a contested area or position to the enemy"" (JP 1-02). It includes both ballistic missile defense and air breathing threat defense, and encompasses point defense, area defense, and high value airborne asset defense. Passive defense is ""measures taken to reduce the probability of and to minimize the effects of damage caused by hostile action without the intention of taking the initiative"" (JP 1-02). It includes detection and warning; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense; camouflage, concealment, and deception; hardening; reconstitution; dispersion; redundancy; and mobility, counter-measures, and stealth.",What is one of the many ways the DCA utilizes passive defense to protect from enemy attacks? ,"{'text': ['counter-measures'], 'answer_start': [1126]}","One way that the Defensive Counterair (DCA) utilizes passive defense to protect against enemy attacks is through camouflage, concealment, and deception. This involves using covert techniques such as paint schemes, camouflage netting, and other tactics to hide airborne assets from enemy radar systems or visual observation.
